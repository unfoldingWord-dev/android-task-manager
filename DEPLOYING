These notes are just to help me remember how to publish the package.

A great tutorial on how to get set up can be found at http://inthecheesefactory.com/blog/how-to-upload-library-to-jcenter-maven-central-as-dependency/en.

1. Make sure your local.properties has been properly set up to include your bintray info
2. build the app using `gradlew install`
3. upload using `gradlew bintrayUpload`
